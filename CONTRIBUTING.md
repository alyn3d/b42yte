### Typescript / Jest
The whole module is written in Typescript and compiles to es5 js. Tests are written in Jest but they are not mandatory, I just wrote some in order to figure how tests work in Jest. Hah. Go figure. 

# This guide
This file will be updated with new information if I figure there's a need for it.
